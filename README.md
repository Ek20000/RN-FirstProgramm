The JSON Files in the asset folder are some example Animations that I implemented via Lottie. If you add an entry you have a blue animated checkbox. If you swipe a Listitem to the left
a white view will appear, if you press on that white field, the second animation triggers. Afterwards, the entry gets deleted. 

The Plugin 'RBSheets' is awesome for bottom drawer modals, consider that in some cases. I may be a creative way to show some form or information (maybe for setting the repeating schedule of a appointment)
